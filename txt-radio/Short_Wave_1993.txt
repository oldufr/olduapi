Well, let's see if I can list a few shortwave frequencies here.  You won't
find any major startling news on these, but sometimes you find things
discussed (like the New World Order, for example) which are discussed in a
manner that indicates everyone else in the world knows all about it, but our
media is not telling us about it.

BBC = British Broadcasting Corporation
VOA = Voice of America
 DW = Deutsche Welle (Cologne, Germany)

RKI = Radio Kol Israel
 RA = Radio Australia
SRI = Swiss Radio International
 RS = Radio Sweden
 RB = Radio Baghdad
 RH = Radio Havana (Cuba - Castro's propaganda station)
RDI = Radio Dublin International
 RN = Radio Netherlands

All of these stations broadcast at varying times of the day and direct their
transmission to particular areas of the world.  Sometimes you'll hear the
same station and the same program on more than one frequency; sometimes
you'll hear the same station and different programming on different
frequencies.  Sometimes you'll tune in a station that's 'supposed' to be one
thing and you'll find some other station on it; they swap around a lot
according to who's on the air at a given time and who isn't -- and often they
don't care whether they trample another station or not.  Also, propagation
factors mean that the above 10mHz frequencies are more easily heard in the
daytime, and the below 10mHz frequencies are more easily heard evenings.  The
below 9mHz frequencies are more easily heard in the early morning hours
(0300+ local).

Also, of course, you can pick up accurate time signals from WWV at Fort
Collins, Colorado, and WWVH in Honolulu, on 2.5, 5, 10, 15, and 20mHz.  Canada
also has time signals, but I don't remember the frequencies.

One note:  You will find ALL the foreign-based stations far to the left
politically.

Good luck, and have fun!  Hope you hear a couple of clandestine stations
transmitting code groups just to keep your blood flowing -- or some of the
occasional 6.6mHz stuff in rapid-fire Spanish with machine gun fire in the
background.

73's.  Don, WB6OCO.
