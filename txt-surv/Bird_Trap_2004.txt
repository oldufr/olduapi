Title: bird boxes
Date:  Sat Feb 17, 1996 23:15:00

Dig a trench angling down to about 8 inches deep in a field or other area
where dove and quail hang out.  The trench should be about 2 feet long.  Over
the deep end of the trench place a wooden box (or other heavy box) open
end down. This will work better if there are holes or slats in the top
(bottom) of the box.  Place corn kernals or other bird food along the inside
of the trench in inside the box.  The holes in the top of the box allow light
in and provide "SKY" so that when the birds eat their way along the trench and
into the box, they will look UP when they are finished eating and ready to
leave.  It never crosses their little bird brains to go back out the way they
came in as long as they can look up and see the sky... they try to fly out UP.
Their may be three or four birds in the box at once so check it carefull
several times a day.  Many boxes set out at once means better chances of
success.  If you have all the birds you can store...let the rest go free.
