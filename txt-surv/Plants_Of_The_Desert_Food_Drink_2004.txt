                         PLANTS OF THE DESERT:


NORTHERN CACTI FURNISH FOOD & DRINK: 

The fruits & fleshy sections of N. American Cacti ARE EDIBLE raw,
boiled, roasted even fried. Yet be very careful in removing the
bristles & spikes usually this is done easier by heat or by
cutting off the outer tissue.

DESERT KALAHARI PLANT: * 

COOKING DESERT PLANT:

Click-clack our Bantu guide went into the bush and came back
after 15 min with a harmful of plants that had yellow nodules
about the size of a golf ball on their stalks.

He tore off the foliage and puts the nodules in the hot sand near
the remains of the campfire. Then he tore a long tendril out of
the ground and picked its bulbous pods until he had gathered
enough for a meal.

He peeled the thumb sized beans from the pods and added them to
the nodules. They took a long time to cook but were survival food
to eat.
