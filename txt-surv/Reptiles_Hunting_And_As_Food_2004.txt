SMALL GAME HUNTING: (It buggs me?)

An ancient method for securing already cooked insects,
reptiles & small animals is to fire large tracts of
grassland and then to comb them for whatever may have been
roasted by the fire.

PREPARING REPTILES:

Discard internal organs that may carry salmonella. Reptiles
can be cooked in their skins. Large snake can be chopped
into steaks and provide useful skins.

To prepare a snake, cut off head well down, behind poison
sacs, open vent to neck, keeping blade outwards to AVOID
piercing innards which will fall clear.

Impale to suspend and ease off skin towards tail, remove the
entrails and cook like chicken to whose meat it is often
compared.

SNAKES & LIZARDS:

Best gutted and then cooked in their skins that are tough
and leathery. Place in hot embers & turn continually. When
the skin splits apart the meat can be removed and boiled.

A few snakes have poisonous secretions on the skin and others
may have venom glands in their head, so cut it off before
cooking. If you are not sure whether they are safe, take
care in handling them.

Both lizards and snakes are not only digestible & EDIBLE but
are often considered delicacies for which some will pay a
higher price than prime beef. 

The only time snake meat may be poisonous is when it has suffered
a venomous bite perhaps from its own fangs. This also holds true
with lizard, the only poisonous lizard is the Gila's monster and
Mexico Beaded Lizard.*

LIZARDS:  = POOR FOOD!

They are hard to catch & they don't have enough meat on them
to justify the energy spent to capture them.

However note that all reptiles are mostly made of flesh thus
good for food. Beside being easy to catch with a stick or
stone. You MUST remove the head and the intestines before
frying or boiling them.

REPTILES & AMPHIBIANS ROAST:

Frogs, small snakes, lizards can be roasted at the end of a
stick. Big snake and Eels have better taste if boiled first
before roasting them. Roasted Salamander IS COMESTIBLE.

FROGS = EDIBLE!:

Hunting is very good at night if you use a torch or lamp but
AVOID to capture #crapaud# since they are toxic. Cut the
head off, remove the thighs and then remove the skins  &
empty it before cooking or boiling them. Many frogs have
poisonous skins. Roast on a stick.

TURTLE STEW!:

The turtles are exceptionally tasty boiled or fried. Make
the turtle to boil till the shell detaches, then cut the
flesh that you will mix with tubercles and plants to obtain
a soup.
