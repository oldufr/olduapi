Title: Turkey
Date:  Sun Feb 18, 1996 18:44:44

To make a good Turkey trap, turn a 55 gallon drum (with the top cut out) over
and set it up on a couple of cinderblocks.  Put corn feed, or other good
Turkey food under it.  The turkey will get under the drum and when he finishes
eating will stand up, and is too dumb to get out.  When you check the trap
you will see the turkey's legs under the barrel. Just grab him by the legs
and drag him out.  Remember that several of these traps working will better
your odds of food. Release what you can't use or store.



Title: More Turkey
Date:  Sun Feb 18, 1996 18:50:47

This one has been seen to work well.  String a trot-line up in an area
frequented by Turkey.  Put corn on all the hooks and lay it on the ground
kinda mixed in with the leaves.  When the Turkey eats the corn he will be
caught on the hook. Sometimes you get more than one.  Not pretty, but it seems
to work good and the bottom line here is FOOD for your Family... not
sportsmanship.

(String up several Trot-lines, as the more traps you have working for you
the better your chances are of getting food.)
