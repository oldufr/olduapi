Subject: Battery lesson learned the hard way.

From time to time measure the current flow with everything turned off for the 12 
volt battery supply at your survival site.   Things can creep into use that draw 
power even when turned off.   We recently found that a 12 volt TV will use about 
1 watt (.08amp) all the time, even when off.  This is the sensor circuit that is 
constantly listening to the wireless remote.  If you purchase any 12 Volt items 
with infrared remotes it will draw current while turned off.  Avoid this.  
Measuring the current flow with everything turned off once in a while will point 
out the power wasters for you.  

A simple low cost amp meter can be made from a $3 digital voltmeter item 90899 
from http://www.harborfreight.com/ and alligator clips a given distance (see 
below) apart clipped onto your existing 12 volt feed wire.  See: “How to Make 
High Amperage DC Current Meter” sent in May 7, 07.

It shows that input wire with following sizes can be used
AWG
Gauge   Inches of wire with clip at each end measuring voltage
 2         76.7
 4         48.3
 6         30.3
 8         19.1
10         12.0
12          7.5
The electricity passes through this feed wire to your site from the batteries. 
Larger wires are noted in the report.
