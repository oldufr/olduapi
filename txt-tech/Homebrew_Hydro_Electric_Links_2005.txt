
Look into:
dc treadmill motors
Runner for alternator
Hydro-power alternator runner
Permanent magnet alternator
Permanent magnet motor low speed
Pm-1000
PMG alternators
Francis Impulse Turbine

A number of alternator builders/rebuilders are offering PM conversions or new 
PMG alternators especially for marine applications. I think a lot of the new 42 
volt auto alternators will also be PM for improved efficiency. I am not sure 
what will be required to regulate the output, but there should be some kind of 
internal regulation available. Some inexpensive PWM electronics could regulate 
voltage over a wide range of RPMs. The vehicle's computer could regulate it, 
tho.......

'volvo' generator. 
We made one quite similar here, it wasn't very 
difficult, after we got the right materials. 
If you want to rewind a car alternator, 
please see:
http://www.mtmscientific.com/rewind.html 
The job itself isn't very difficult. 
You only need to rewind the stator coils with
thinner copper wires. The same way as they were, but more turns. 
If you want to try a conversion of 
a car alternator into pmg, please see:

I have long been interested in Micro-Hydro power. I found this egroup.com/micro 
hydropower group. In future I hope to start a micro hydropower project. So I 
think this will be very useful for me and others to share our 
knowledge/information.
